# Introduction 
This project aims to create a diagnostic interface for all future trainers. To do this a gateway will be used to communicate with external displays/devices. 
The gateway will communicate with the trainer through CAN (see diagram in repo for layout). The functionality of this interface will allow it to display trouble codes, 
reset trouble codes, and display live data to user.

# -------------------------------------------------Gateway test setup------------------------------------------------------
# Getting Started
To properly setup the development in your system, follow these steps:
1. If using VS Code, install the "ESP-IDF" Extension.
2. Clone the repository into a local folder.
3. The "ESP-IDF Welcome" page will be automatically prompted by ESP-IDF (If not, type ">ESP-IDF: Configure ESP-IDF Extension" onto the search bar).
4. Select "Configure extension".
5. Make sure to update the paths for idf.espIdfPathWin, idf.toolsPathWin, and idf.pythonInstallPath in settings.json
6. Choose the "Express" mode (unless a configuration already exists; then select "Use Existing Setup") and follow the steps to configure the extension.
Note: See General help Build and Flash for help flashing from ESP-IDF onto ESP32s

# Breadboard Setup
Use two esp32 or one esp32 or using an esp32, trainer, and app/display for testing. Current code is setup only for two esp32's.
1. Set up esp32 so they are powered and respective programs onto them (see build and flashing).
2. Create a can bus using 2 transeivers and 2 terminating resistors.
3. Connect both RX and tx pin for TWAI to the 2 transceivers based on transceiver data sheet (rx pin only designed to read 3.3v do not use for rx input 5v). 
4. Connect RX uart pin to TX pin uart pin of opposite board for both (this is for testing with two esp32s).
Note: If using external display and trainer then step 4 will not apply. With trainer, connect trainer to CAN bus. With a dispaly connect it to the gateway through uart. 
If using bt connect dispaly/app through bt.

#--------------------------------Display Setup---------------------------------------
1. Have STMCUBE IDE installed and open it(also have touchgfx installed)
2. Once in touchgfx go to file->Open Projects From Files Systems
3. Once in the Import Projects from File Systems or Archive window press the Directory button.
4. Then select the UART_Display_3 folder which will should find two projects
5. Click finish in the bottom right
6. Once in open the STM32H750B-DK project file in the middle of the files
7. Go to Application->User then the files in this folder are the user files for this project. The GUI folder and touchgfx folder also have user made files in them.
8. Connect stm link on STM32H750B-DK to computer and click the run button(if an error pops up try changing debug/run config)

# -------------------------------------------------------------General Help --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build and Flash
(NOTE: Make sure you open the sub-folder with the main.c file in vs code BEFORE building. Trying to build the entire repo will NOT work.)
1. Re-configure ESP-IDF Extension after opening the sub-folder.
2. Type ">ESP-IDF: Build your project" into search bar or press "Ctrl + E, B".
2. To monitor/flash: type ">ESP-IDF: Build, flash, and start a monitor on your device" into the search bar or press "Ctrl + E, D"


# Post Flash
If the board does not automatically leave bootloader mode:
1. Set IO0 pin to HIGH or remove from GND
2. Press RESET/RST (EN) button. If button not present, manually connect the "EN" pin to GND and disconnect.


# -------------------------------------------------------------BLE Setup --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Once cloned all files, add "ble.c" to CmakeLists and remove any BT_SPP related code
2. Open menuconfig, disable Bluetooth Classic under bluedroid, enable BLE, and enable BLE ONLY in controller options
3. Reconfigure, build, and pray

# ____________________Steps to operate modes

# Mode 01- Show Current Data (Live Data)

1. Press the live data button from the home screen to go to the read live data screen. 
2. Once on the live data screen the GUI will request the full bit-mask of available PIDs(uint8_t [7][4]) and send it to the GUI(display) through UART. 
    *See UART and can communication section for more detail.
3. Once the bit-mask has been sent over and a checksum is passed the scroll list will become visible with all the elements that were 1's in the bit-mask
    *bit-mask will have 1 for support service and 0 for unsupported.
4. After loading the scroll list the elements that are visible will start to update every 3 seconds. See steps below for work flow
    *GUI sends PID(see UART section) to the Gateway
    *Gateway request makes service 1 request with PID to the CAN network(see CAN section)
    *Gateway receives response or timesout and sends 0 as the value(note that this should probably be change seeing that 0 is a valid value most the time).
    *Gateway sends value to GUI which then updates value text box
    *Another PID will be requested and this will go on until pid 0x20(an avaible PIDs bitmask request is made) then it will exit
        *Display sends 0x20 instead of end command when pressing home button

# Mode 03 (stored DTCs), 07 (Pending DTCs), and 0A (Permanent DTCs)

1. Press read codes button from home screen to be taking to TC_Read screen
2. Press desired service (stored, pending, or permmanent)
3. Display request selected service from Gateway(see UART section below)
4. Gateway request from CAN network(see CAN section below)
5. Gateway sends encoded bytes to display(see CAN section for encoding description & UART section for protocol)
6. Display decodes and updates scroll list with all DTCs sent

# Mode 04

1. Once in the read codes screen with codes displayed in the scroll list the clear codes button will become visible
2. Press it to have the display tell the Gateway to send the clear codes request to CAN network (See CAN and UART section)


# -------------------------------------------------------------CAN Communication Outline--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAN frames are used made of up of 8 sections each with a number of bytes 1-11. The only parts that change based on request during communication is the ID and the data section.
* The data section is always held at 8 bytes in length with padding bytes added if needed. 
* The ID for the requester is between 0x7DF - 0x7E0. 0x7DF is a request that will be checked by all ECUs on the network while all the others will request to a specific ECU(0x7E0 is for the ECM). The data will change based on the service requested see below.

# CAN/TWAI SPECS
Speed  : 500k
Filter :  0x7E8 to 0x7EF
CAN MSG-----------
*always 8 data bytes per frame as required by standards (0x00 used as padding)
*ID = 0x7E8 to request to all ECUs and 0x7E8 â€“ 0x7EF

# Service 0x01 Request 
Service 1 request will use the 0x7DF ID to ping all ECUs. The 0th data byte will be a 2 representing the number of data bytes excluding itself. The 1st data byte
will represent the requested mode/service(mode byte which is 0x01 for mode 1). The next byte is the Parameter Identifications(PID) requested.

Data Section:
Byte 0: Number bytes (0x02)
Byte 1: Mode byte (0x01)      
Byte 2: PID (0x00 - 0xC8)
Byte 3: Padding (0x00 or simulare)
Byte 4: Padding (0x00 or simulare)  
Byte 5: Padding (0x00 or simulare)       
Byte 6: Padding (0x00 or simulare)   
Byte 7: Padding (0x00 or simulare)   

# Service 0x01 Response
Response to service 1 will come in either of 2 forms. Single frame response( >= 6 data bytes) or multiframe which can be up to 100 bytes or more.
* Single frames will have the total number of bytes(0-7) in the 0th byte, mode response in the 1st byte, then repeat PID, and the rest will be data or padding depending on amount of returned bytes per PID. 
* A multiframe will have byte 0 as 0x10 to represent that it is the first frame of a multi frame message. Byte 1 will be the total number of data bytes for all frames + mode byte + PID echo. The 2nd byte will be the mode byte followed by the PID echoed and the rest as data. This is then followed by CFwhich has the first byte as 0x2N (N being the number consecutive frame it is) followed by data/padding. After the first frame of a multiframe the next frame won't be sent until the requester sends a flow control frame which has the 0th byte as 0x30, 1st byte as the number of CF able to be sent before another frame should be sent, the 2nd byte should be the separation time(0 = ASAP).

# Service 0x03, 0x04, 0x07, and 0x0A Request  
These services are all related to DTCs and the request works in a simulare way. With the 0th byte being the number of bytes (1) and the 1st bytes being the request. Note the the number of bytes in the request is only 1 for these modes and not two. Making it two will cause it to be ignored by ECU's most times. The rest of the data section is padding.

Data Section:
Byte 0: Number bytes (0x01)
Byte 1: Mode byte (0x03, 0x04, 0x07, or 0x0A)      
Byte 2: Padding (0x00 or simulare)
Byte 3: Padding (0x00 or simulare)
Byte 4: Padding (0x00 or simulare)  
Byte 5: Padding (0x00 or simulare)       
Byte 6: Padding (0x00 or simulare)   
Byte 7: Padding (0x00 or simulare)   

#Service 0x03, 0x04, 0x07, and 0x0A Response
The response to the DTC request 0x03, 0x04, and 0x07 are the same as service 0x01 but without the PID echo and DTCs coming in two bytes cannot be split between frames. This means that there will be more padding. The response for 0x0A is shown below. A bad response will have one of two different mode bytes. The first is a good response meaning all codes were cleared (0x44). The second being 0x7F which represents a bad response, meaning the codes were not cleared. 

Differences with service 1:
*No PID ECHO
*DTC come in two bytes and cannot be split across frames so there  will be more padding(padding not counted in byte count)

# This is a negative response for any mode shown below

# Negative response
A negative response always has 0x7F as the mode byte and looks like the following.
Data Section:
Byte 0: 0x03        ; Number of data bytes (3)
Byte 1: 0x7F        ; Negative response indicator
Byte 2: 0x01        ; Echo of the requested mode (Mode 1)
Byte 3: 0x11        ; NRC: Service not supported code
Byte 4: 0x00        ; Padding
Byte 5: 0x00        ; Padding
Byte 6: 0x00        ; Padding
Byte 7: 0x00        ; Padding

 # -------------------------------------------------------------UART Communication Outline--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# UART - Display interaction
UART is used to communicate with the Gateway chip which will provide data request by the display. See UART_COMMS.hpp for UART commands. Note that this is currently not just one file included by all but in three different locations. For Display it is the UART_COMMS.hpp, for Gateway it is in the UART header, and for slave it is in the UART header.
